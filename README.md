# Getting Started
Meeting Organizer Project is a web application that manages individuals' meeting processes. The project is developed using the Django web framework in the Python language.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11.x
- PostgreSQL
- Django

### Installation
- Before running the application, you need to create a database on PostgreSQL.
- Then, create a virtual environment and install the requirements in the project directory.
- Inside the "meetingapp" folder, create a .env file and input the following data:

```python
SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
DB_NAME=YOUR_DB_NAME
DB_USER=YOUR_DB_USER
DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
```
- Now, you are ready to run the application.

### Notes
- **You can import the Postman collection file into your application to access and use the necessary endpoints.**
- **You can use "manage.py test" within the application to execute the written tests.**

### How It Works
Among the main functionalities of the project are creating, editing, deleting, and viewing all your meetings.
